It is located in Peru of South America. Machu Picchu used to be a city located on a very small hill. In the 15th century, the Inca civilization lives in Machu Picchu, 2430 meters above sea level. 
How is the city in such a height, it is a matter of thinking and this makes it the 7th wonder of the world. 
Archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was built around Raja Pachakuti around 1400. After 100 years of it, Spain won it and left it like this. 
They had no attachment with this, after which there was no one to look after it, which destroyed the civilization that remained here. 
This place also revolved around this, but in 1911 American historian Hiram Bingham discovered it and brought it to the world. In 1983 UNESCO declared it the World Heritage Site. 
The artwork of Inca civilization can be seen here today, many of them there are still things that were created by them. Machu Picchu attracts the attention of tourists, and many people go to see it.This “city in the clouds” was built 8,000 feet above sea level in the 15th century by Incan emperor Pachacutec. Abandoned by the Incas, the city remained unknown until it was rediscovered by an explorer in 1911.
